#### About me
💬 I'm David, a <i>data engineer</i> working towards being able to architect and build highly-scalable, robust, and maintainable systems. This Github profile is a collection of projects developed as I continuously learn towards achieving that goal.

💻 I have professional experience with Python, Go, SQL (snowflake), Airflow, and more. You can view my full resume here: [resume](resume/David_Shipman_Resume_Updated_11_19_2022.pdf)
